Poles = -2, -4 (from the system), -6 (from the compensator)
Zeros = -5 (from the compensator)

n - m = 3 - 1 = 2
q = 0, 1

Phi_A = (2q+1)/(n-m) * 180 = 90, 270

C = (sum(Finite poles)-sum(Finite zeros))/(n-m) = ((-2-4-6) - (-5) )/(2) = (-12+5)/2 = -7/2 = -3.5

Note: the centroid C is not the breakaway point from the real axis.
