## Install

The notebooks run with python 3.9 and use the following python libraries:
- sympy
- python control
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib 
- opencv-python

Notebook `01_Getting_started_with_Python_and_Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb` provides a short introduction on how to set up an anaconda environment to get you started.


`pip install your_project_name`

## How to use

Each notebook is thought to be independent from every other, so it is possible to run them in any order you prefer.
